3. One job that is related to data science is a **machine learning engineer**. At [large companies](https://www.google.com), there are employees whose job it is to take a dataset generated by their software through a process of cleaning, filtering, and analyzing. After all of the *legwork* has been completed, the machine learning engineer takes the data and begins to develop a model. As more and more data is fed into the model, it becomes more and more accurate at future predictions. ![](img.png)
